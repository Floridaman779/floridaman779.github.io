# Tutorial for Plex access
## Step 1: Sign up on Plex
Go to the [Plex website](plex.tv) and click on "sign up". Enter your email (remember this for step 2) and choose a safe password. Then click on "Create an account".
You will receive a verification Email in which you have to click the "verify email" button.

## Step 2: Sign up on this website
Fill in the form below this text. Use the email you used on Plex. In the text box write a Pin code (4 numbers) you want to use to log in to the Plex library. Then click "send" and wait until I send you on Plex a invitation. You will receive an email when I do so. Then accept the invitation. As soon as you've done so you can log in to my Plex library with the Pin you've written in the text box.
